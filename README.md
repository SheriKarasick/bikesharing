# Key question: Are there opportunities for CikiBike in one of the most commute friendly cities in America? [1]

### Summary Analysis
Analysis utilizes New York City as a comparison city for exploring the potential viability of a CitiBike franchise in Des Moines, Iowa.  The data is visually presented using Tableau to identify business insights that will help understand the market forecast.  This report builds on robust CitiBike user data to understand how it will compare to the target market [2], a market research report that provides insights into patterns of bike use by geographical region in the United States [3] and a brief SWOT analysis informed by the Catch Des Moines organization [4].

### Comparison City Data
There are substantial differences between the comparison city New York City and Des Moines, Iowa.  However, insights can still be gained by examining user information and behavior to determine whether or not Des Moines is a target city for expansion of the CitiBike franchise.

The advantages of the data set include: 
* 2,344,224 individual data points -- rides -- for evaluation.  All data comes from the month of August, a high traffic month.
* A fleet of 13,983 bicycles used by two customer types.
* 794 working bike rental stations.

### Market Research on Bike Use Finds that Americans Desire to Bike More

Independent market research was conducted to understand patterns among users of bicycles. The results are prescient for this analysis.  (Breakaway Research Group, 2015)

* More than half of Americans over 18 would like to bike more often and perceive biking as a convenient mode of transportation.

* Concern about motor vehicle traffic is a key barrier.

* Availability of an operational bicycle is also a key barrier.  This is evidence for supporting bike sharing programs.

### A Brief SWOT

  **Strengths: Des Moines's bike friendliness is a strength.**
   - Des Moines offers an inside "city walk" for its residents.  The four mile track allows people to navigate the city without having to pass outside, promoting healthy behaviors during weather months where environment does not favor out door transportation.

  - Des Moines offers a robust business district downtown for young professionals in the target market.

  - Downtown Des Moines hosts a young population, within target age range.

  **Weaknesses: Potential market size is a weakness.**
  
  - Potential market in Des Moines significantly smaller than New York City [5].

  - The Sky Walk structures compete with safe and comfortable indoor transportation in all weather [4].
  
  **Opportunities: Other events create opportunities in expanding bike use.**
  
  - Des Moines is hosting the Ironman competition which will bring more interest in cycling to the area [4].

  - Increases in environmental awareness and sensitivity are causing conscious consumers to be more aware of their choices.
  
  
  **Threats: Climate controlled infrastructure already in place is a potential threat.**
  
  - Climate controlled infrastructure for walking a four mile section of the city already exists [4].

  - The central downtown area is home to a very small residential population.  Reduced by gender and age bias and percentage of any general population that is inclined to be a bicycle user the potential market is very small (<1500 users).

  - Des Moines is the most commuter friendly city in America, a majority of the population lives outside of a range where casual riders would be inclined to bike for their commute, or even a casual weekend in the city.
